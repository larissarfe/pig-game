-- When the button hold is clicked it means that we want to add the current score to the total score 

---> WE WANT SOMETHING TO HAPPEN WHEN THE USER CLICKS ON THE HOLD BUTTON 

we are using an array to hold the scores in the scores variable - THE ARRAY HOLDS THE SOCRE AT THE SAME TIME OF PLAYER 0 AND PLAYER 1 
diceEl.classList.add('hidden');
const scores = [0, 0]; // THE SCORES WILL BE AN ARRAY POSITION 0 FOR THE PLAYER 1 POSITION 1 FOR PLAYER 2
let currentScore = 0;
let activePlayer = 0;
let playing = true;
